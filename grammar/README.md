## notes on Dreyer's English

```text
We all write, all the time: books, blogs, emails. Lots and lots of emails. And we
all want to write better. Benjamin Dreyer is here to help.

As Random House’s copy chief, Dreyer has upheld the standards of the legendary
publisher for more than two decades. He is beloved by authors and editors alike—not
to mention his followers on social media—for deconstructing the English language with
playful erudition. Now he distills everything he has learned from the myriad books he
has copyedited and overseen into a useful guide not just for writers but for everyone 
who wants to put their best prose foot forward.

As authoritative as it is amusing, Dreyer’s English offers lessons on punctuation, from the
underloved semicolon to the enigmatic en dash; the rules and nonrules of grammar, including
why it’s OK to begin a sentence with “And” or “But” and to confidently split an infinitive;
and why it’s best to avoid the doldrums of the Wan Intensifiers and Throat Clearers, including
“very,” “rather,” “of course,” and the dreaded “actually.” Dreyer will let you know whether
“alright” is all right (sometimes) and even help you brush up on your spelling—though, as
he notes, “The problem with mnemonic devices is that I can never remember them.”
